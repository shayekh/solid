# solid

#SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design.

They are conceptualized by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob). They are:

#Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

#Open-Closed Principle: Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#Liskov Substitution Principle: Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

#Interface Segregation Principle: A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

#Dependency Inversion Principle: Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
